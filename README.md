# design_patterns
This is a repository with basic implementations of different design patterns, as a handy tool for reference. It is based on java implementations of: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog 

This is just for references. There are several projects (each per pattern) and they don't suppose an util industrial piece of code.

Recently, I discovered there was an repositorie from RefactoringGuru: https://github.com/RefactoringGuru/design-patterns-java
It contains basicly the same stuff, but the main diference here is that my code works in eclipse :v
